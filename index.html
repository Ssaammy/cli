    <title>The Great wall of china</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>The Chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall-building by the time of the Spring and Autumn period between the 8th and 5th centuries BC. During this time and the subsequent Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Han, Yan, and Zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders. Built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears, these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames.</p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p>Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources; stone was used in montane areas, while rammed earth was used while building in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls; most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands of workers died building the Qin wall. Later, the Han, the Northern dynasties and the Sui all repaired, rebuilt, or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders. The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region. Dynasties founded by non-Han ethnic groups also built border walls: the Xianbei-ruled Northern Wei, the Khitan-ruled Liao, Jurchen-led Jin and the Tangut-established Western Xia, who ruled vast territories over Northern China throughout centuries, all constructed defensive walls, albeit being further north—reaching into the environs of present-day Mongolia—than Han-built fortifications.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of construction</h3>
    <p>the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600. Even after the loss of all of Liaodong, the Ming army held the heavily fortified Shanhai Pass, preventing the Manchus from conquering the Chinese heartland. The Manchus were finally able to cross the Great Wall in 1644, after Beijing had already fallen to Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun dynasty. Before this time, the Manchus had crossed the Great Wall multiple times to raid, but this time it was for conquest. The gates at Shanhai Pass were opened on May 25 by the commanding Ming general, Wu Sangui, who formed an alliance with the Manchus, hoping to use the Manchus to expel the rebels from Beijing. The Manchus quickly seized Beijing instead, and eventually defeated both the Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, consolidating the rule of the Qing dynasty over all of China proper.
     Under Qing rule and the annexation of Mongolia into the empire, China's borders extended beyond the Great Wall; work on it for the purpose of border defense was thus discontinued. Construction nevertheless persisted with projects like the Willow Palisade; following a line similar to that of the Liaodong Wall of the Ming, it was meant to prevent Han Chinese migration into Manchuria.

     <h4>Traits of the wall</h4>
     <ol type="I">
        <li>Length: The Great Wall stretches over 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) across northern China, making it the longest wall in the world.</li>
        <li>Construction: Built over several dynasties, starting in the 7th century BC and continuing until the 17th century, the wall was constructed using a variety of materials including earth, wood, brick, and stone, depending on the region and time period.</li>
        <li>Purpose: Originally constructed to protect Chinese states from invasions by nomadic tribes like the Mongols and the Xiongnu. It also served as a physical boundary, a symbol of imperial power, and a means of communication and transportation.</li>
        <li>Design: The wall is not a single continuous structure but rather a series of walls and fortifications, including watchtowers, barracks, and fortresses, which were used for defense, storage, and as military stations.</li>
        <li>Strategic Features: The wall was designed with various defensive features, such as sharp bends to slow down invaders, watchtowers for signaling, and trap doors or drop pits for enemy soldiers.</li>
        <li>Cultural Impact: The Great Wall has become a symbol of China's historical strength and determination. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists each year.</li>
        <li>Historical Significance: The wall reflects the historical efforts to defend China from external threats and the ingenuity in building such an extensive and durable structure.</li>
